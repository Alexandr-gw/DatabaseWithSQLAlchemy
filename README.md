Hello, this is a microservice project for the selection of drugs by symptoms.

This web service first identifies the patient and the doctor. The patient, after entering the mandatory field of symptoms and the optional field of contraindications, presses the "confirm" button, after which he gets to another page where he personally sees the name of the suitable drugs for his symptoms.
For the correct operation of the service, the business processes that will operate in it were thought out.
